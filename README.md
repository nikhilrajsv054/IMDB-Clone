# IMDB Clone
This is a simple IMDB clone web application that allows users to search for movies from the OMDB API and view details about each movie. The application features a Home Page, Movie Page, and My Favourite Movies Page. Below are the key features of the application:

### Home Page
Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend.
As the user types, the search results update dynamically, similar to Google's suggestions.
Each search result has a favourite button. Clicking on it adds the movie to "My favourite movies" list.
Clicking on any movie in the search result opens a new page with more detailed information about that movie.

### Movie Page
Displays detailed information about the selected movie, such as its name, photo, and plot.

### My Favourite Movies Page
Displays a list of all the favourite movies added by the user.
The list is persistent, even after closing or refreshing the browser.
Each movie in the favourites list has a "Remove from favourites" button to allow users to remove movies from the list.
This IMDB clone is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the OMDB API to fetch movie data and localStorage to store favourite movies locally. The application is designed to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface to explore and manage their favourite movies.

### Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Start searching for your favourite movies and enjoy the movie details!

It is a basic demonstration of fetching data from an API, dynamic content display, and local storage usage. Feel free to explore and enhance the application further based on your preferences!
